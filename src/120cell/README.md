# The 120 cell

Currently only a coarse version, many brute force code, to be cleaned.


## How to use this program


This program needs the raytracer `POV-Ray` and the module `vapory` be installed on your computer. Just run `main.py`.

If you don't want to run POV - Ray in a python shell, you may wait a few seconds until POV-Ray pops the display window, close it to
kill the process, and run `povray render.ini`. This will restart the rendering in shell.


### Thanks

The data in cell120.py is taken from `xscreensaver`. It's a bit (but not too much) tedious to computer these data by oneself, so I just
borrowed them. 

Thanks [DeltaSimplex](https://www.youtube.com/user/DeltaSimplex) for teaching me how to set the texture for the faces, and [Zulko](https://github.com/Zulko) for his 
`vapory` module.
